       "2  [CollateX](http://collatex.net/) is a software to\\n\\n 1. read **multiple (≥ 2) versions of a text**, splitting each version into parts (tokens) to be compared,\\n 1. **identify similarities of and differences between the versions** (including moved/transposed segments) by aligning tokens, and\\n 1. output the alignment results in a **variety of formats for further processing**, for instance\\n 1. to support **the production of a critical apparatus** or the stemmatical analysis of a text's genesis.\\n\\nIt resembles software used to compute differences between files (e.g. [diff](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff)) or tools for [sequence alignment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_alignment) which are commonly used in Bioinformatics. While CollateX shares some of the techniques and algorithms with those tools, it mainly aims for a flexible and configurable approach to the problem of finding similarities and differences in texts, sometimes trading computational soundness or complexity for the user's ability to influence results.\\n\\nAs such it is primarily designed for use cases in disciplines like [Philology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philology) or – more specifically – the field of [Textual Criticism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textual_criticism) where the assessment of findings is based on interpretation and therefore can be supported by computational means but is not necessarily computable.\\n\\nPlease go to <http://collatex.net/> for further information.   \n",

       "2  [CollateX](http://collatex.net/) is a software to  1. read  multiple (≥ 2) versions of a text , splitting each version into parts (tokens) to be compared,  1.  identify similarities of and differences between the versions  (including moved/transposed segments) by aligning tokens, and  1. output the alignment results in a  variety of formats for further processing , for instance  1. to support  the production of a critical apparatus  or the stemmatical analysis of a text's genesis. It resembles software used to compute differences between files (e.g. [diff](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff)) or tools for [sequence alignment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_alignment) which are commonly used in Bioinformatics. While CollateX shares some of the techniques and algorithms with those tools, it mainly aims for a flexible and configurable approach to the problem of finding similarities and differences in texts, sometimes trading computational soundness or complexity for the user's ability to influence results. As such it is primarily designed for use cases in disciplines like [Philology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philology) or – more specifically – the field of [Textual Criticism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textual_criticism) where the assessment of findings is based on interpretation and therefore can be supported by computational means but is not necessarily computable.

It resembles software used to compute differences between files (e.g. [diff](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff)) or tools for [sequence alignment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_alignment) which are commonly used in Bioinformatics. While CollateX shares some of the techniques and algorithms with those tools, it mainly aims for a flexible and configurable approach to the problem of finding similarities and differences in texts, sometimes trading computational soundness or complexity for the user's ability to influence results. As such it is primarily designed for use cases in disciplines like [Philology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philology) or – more specifically – the field of [Textual Criticism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textual_criticism) where the assessment of findings is based on interpretation and therefore can be supported by computational means but is not necessarily computable.

       "2  [CollateX](http://collatex.net/) is a software to  1. read  multiple (≥ 2) versions of a text , splitting each version into parts (tokens) to be compared,  1.  identify similarities of and differences between the versions  (including moved/transposed segments) by aligning tokens, and  1. output the alignment results in a  variety of formats for further processing , for instance  1. to support  the production of a critical apparatus  or the stemmatical analysis of a text's genesis. It resembles software used to compute differences between files (e.g. [diff](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff)) or tools for [sequence alignment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_alignment) which are commonly used in Bioinformatics. While CollateX shares some of the techniques and algorithms with those tools, it mainly aims for a flexible and configurable approach to the problem of finding similarities and differences in texts, sometimes trading computational soundness or complexity for the user's ability to influence results. As such it is primarily designed for use cases in disciplines like [Philology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philology) or – more specifically – the field of [Textual Criticism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textual_criticism) where the assessment of findings is based on interpretation and therefore can be supported by computational means but is not necessarily computable.

The digital tool can support users in transcribing texts in various fields. In addition to the actual transcription, the texts can also be annotated and text-genetic facts can be marked up. Transcribo offers the possibility to transcribe texts productively and in a time-saving way, using the same intuitive approach as you are used to from manual transcription. The tool offers all the subtleties needed for a differentiated transcription and supports the working process both efficiently and easily comprehensible.   Transcribe almost like with sheet and pencil Transcribing is done in a graphical editor directly on the facsimile, simulating the procedure of analog transcribing with sheet and pencil. This intuitive approach is an advantage especially when transcribing difficult to decipher manuscripts or heavily revised typescript pages and additionally reduces the learning time for the tool, since no markup language (e.g. TEI/XML) has to be learned. Another advantage of this method is that by working on the facsimile, a positional link between the transcribed text and the image is automatically stored. This positional data can be used in the context of the electronic presentation to visualize the link between text and facsimile for the user in a sustainable way, e.g. in the form of cross-fades or mouse-over effects.   Can be used both locally and with FuD  Transcribo can be used both locally and in conjunction with our FuD system.  In local operation, facsimiles located on the terminal device can be opened and edited. All processed information is stored locally in the form of XML files. When FuD is used in addition, the data is stored in FuD's own relational database, which enables collaborative work. In addition, some functionalities, such as the recording of cross-page phenomena, the correction tool or the storage of text states, are only available in this operating mode. The many years of development work accompanying the project have paid off.  Thus, adaptations and ideas from numerous humanities projects at TCDH have been incorporated into the work and have resulted in a very differentiated and practically tested tool.    Some of the most important features of Transcribo 1.  Fine-grained markup of microgenetic facts  (at document, page, sentence/line, word, and graph levels) 2.  Markup of complex interrelated phenomena/change operations  via relations (page and cross-page) 3.  Correction function  for automated comparison of A and B files from different users to ensure error-free transcription and annotation ('double-blind process') 4.  OCR functionality  for automatic reading of typescripts or prints (Tesseract) 5.  Navigation perspective:  interface to the FuD database (linking facsimiles with metadata recorded in FuD) 6.  Structural perspective:  overview of a text section of any size (synopsis of different graphical representations: Facsimile, transcription, annotations) and possibility of depositing cross-page phenomena. 7.  Module for defining and labeling text states or text layers.    Technical requirements The application was implemented in the Eclipse integrated development environment. It is a rich client application that reuses parts of the development environment and was developed in the Java programming language. We currently provide a version for Windows and macOS operating systems.

       "      <td>The Virtual Manuscript Room Collaborative Research Environment (VMR CRE) brings community and a toolbox of powerful research components to support all stages of research and production of a digital edition. Beginning with the popular open-source portal, Liferay, the VMR CRE integrates 30 DH components to naturally support: Cataloging witnesses; managing and displaying images; producing well-formed TEI transcriptions using a web-based WYSIWYM editor and storing those transcriptions to a versioned transcription repository; community volunteer task assignment and project management; automatic realtime collation of witnesses; regularization and apparatus editing; online publishing of the final results-- as a traditional apparatus, or with interactive tools which let users choose different ways to visualize the data produced in the edition.    Overview A walk through the workflow at the Institut für neutestamentliche Textforschung (INTF), in their efforts to edit the Editio Critica Maior (ECM), provides opportunity to touch on many components available in the VMR CRE.  Work can be divided into 9 discrete stages, progressively: 1) witness cataloging; 2) witness selection; 3) image management; 4) indexing of folio content; 5) transcribing; 6) collating; 7) regularizing; 8) editing an apparatus; 9) genealogical analysis of the witness corpus.   Metadata and Feature Tagging The VMR CRE stores with each manuscript a very limited set of descriptive data, reserving the primary metadata capture for a dynamic tagging facility called Feature Tagging. A Feature is any defined metadata information which might be captured for a manuscript or manuscript page.  For example, an alternative catalog identifier, an external image repository, the canvas material type, the ink type, the script type; these are all Features which might be tagged on a manuscript; For individual pages: an illumination, a canon table, or even individual sample script characters might be tagged as Features.  These Features must first be defined in the system, and the VMR CRE comes by default with a predefined set of Feature Definitions used at the INTF.  A Feature Definition can specify that zero or more values should be captured with the Feature tag and what those value types and value domains should be.  Once a Feature is defined, it can be used to tag manuscripts or manuscript pages, capturing individual Feature values for each tag, if necessary. Every Feature Definition adds to the number of facets available in the catalog search facility.  For example, one might search for all manuscript folio sides from Egypt which include Illuminations and any part of the Gospel of John.  A Feature tagged to a manuscript page can also include a region box, marking the area on a folio image where the Feature is present.  If a region box is captured, a search query can specify to show the region box clips in the result.  For example, a paleographer might choose to capture a set of representative letters for each manuscript and then perform a search for all double column manuscripts with a height of at least 20cm between the II and V centuries, and to ask the query results to show the representative α (alpha) clips.   Transcription and Reconciliation Transcription work in the VMR CRE is done using a What You See Is What You Mean (WYSIWYM) web-based editor originally developed by the University of Trier in collaboration with the INTF and ITSEE in Birmingham.  This transcription editor has been developed as a plugin for the popular TinyMCE HTML editor component.  The editor includes menus and dialogs to assist the researcher with composing a transcription, without asking the transcriber to learn special markup codes.  The content may then be obtained as EpiDoc influenced TEI. The VMR CRE saves content in a versioned transcription repository backed by Git.  A user may have access to create and edit their own personal transcription, a project-wide transcription, or a site-wide (= published) transcription-- each having version history. The VMR CRE also includes a palaeography tool to assist a transcriber when encountering rare symbols, abbreviations, or ligatures.  If a portion of the unknown text can be identified, the researcher can enter one or more letters and will be presented with images of text instances elsewhere which include these letters, offering possibilities.  As more and more rare text items are tagged, the system grows more helpful. Quality assurance for the ECM requires that a transcription for a manuscript be produced independently by two transcribers.  The products are then compared to each other and differences are reviewed by a manager and reconciled to produce a final transcription.  The VMR CRE provides tools to facilitate this reconciliation work. Collation and Visualization Collation is a key component to find differences in text witnesses when producing a critical edition.  Collation facilities in the VMR CRE are performed by CollateX.  Collation and regularization of uninteresting differences is an iterative cycle in digital editing and the VMR CRE ties these two actions together with an intuitive visual interface.  Visualization of a collation, either during the editing process or for the reader, can be rendered as a variant graph, an alignment table, or as a traditional negative apparatus.    Web Services, Open Programmatic Access The VMR CRE Web Services API layer is primarily useful for exposing the functionality of the VMR CRE to other research projects wishing to access the functionality or contribute to the dataset through their own systems and tools.  The VMR CRE Web Services API generally uses noun/verb nomenclature organized by category.  This means that the last 2 segments of an API URL will consist first of the type of object the call will affect, and second, of the action to be performed on the object.  Any path before the final two segments are merely for organizational purposes.  This is different from a strict REST convention which confines the action to one of 6 HTTP verbs.  The VMR CRE places no semantic meaning on the HTTP verb.  Both GET and POST HTTP verbs are accepted as identical, relegating the verb, or semantic action to the final segment of the URL.  This allows easy testing and examples for every action directly within a web browser.  Parameters to a service request are passed as standard HTTP FORM POST parameters or as query string parameters.</td>\n",

The digital tool can support users in transcribing texts in various fields. In addition to the actual transcription, the texts can also be annotated and text-genetic facts can be marked up. Transcribo offers the possibility to transcribe texts productively and in a time-saving way, using the same intuitive approach as you are used to from manual transcription. The tool offers all the subtleties needed for a differentiated transcription and supports the working process both efficiently and easily comprehensible.   Transcribe almost like with sheet and pencil Transcribing is done in a graphical editor directly on the facsimile, simulating the procedure of analog transcribing with sheet and pencil. This intuitive approach is an advantage especially when transcribing difficult to decipher manuscripts or heavily revised typescript pages and additionally reduces the learning time for the tool, since no markup language (e.g. TEI/XML) has to be learned. Another advantage of this method is that by working on the facsimile, a positional link between the transcribed text and the image is automatically stored. This positional data can be used in the context of the electronic presentation to visualize the link between text and facsimile for the user in a sustainable way, e.g. in the form of cross-fades or mouse-over effects.   Can be used both locally and with FuD  Transcribo can be used both locally and in conjunction with our FuD system.  In local operation, facsimiles located on the terminal device can be opened and edited. All processed information is stored locally in the form of XML files. When FuD is used in addition, the data is stored in FuD's own relational database, which enables collaborative work. In addition, some functionalities, such as the recording of cross-page phenomena, the correction tool or the storage of text states, are only available in this operating mode. The many years of development work accompanying the project have paid off.  Thus, adaptations and ideas from numerous humanities projects at TCDH have been incorporated into the work and have resulted in a very differentiated and practically tested tool.    Some of the most important features of Transcribo 1.  Fine-grained markup of microgenetic facts  (at document, page, sentence/line, word, and graph levels) 2.  Markup of complex interrelated phenomena/change operations  via relations (page and cross-page) 3.  Correction function  for automated comparison of A and B files from different users to ensure error-free transcription and annotation ('double-blind process') 4.  OCR functionality  for automatic reading of typescripts or prints (Tesseract) 5.  Navigation perspective:  interface to the FuD database (linking facsimiles with metadata recorded in FuD) 6.  Structural perspective:  overview of a text section of any size (synopsis of different graphical representations: Facsimile, transcription, annotations) and possibility of depositing cross-page phenomena. 7.  Module for defining and labeling text states or text layers.    Technical requirements The application was implemented in the Eclipse integrated development environment. It is a rich client application that reuses parts of the development environment and was developed in the Java programming language. We currently provide a version for Windows and macOS operating systems.

permits registered users to view digital files and transcribe them with an easy-to-use toolbar, rendering that text searchable. The tool includes a versioning history and editorial controls to make public contributions more manageable, and supports the transcription of a wide range of file types (both images and documents). There are two versions of Scripto, each of which works with a different version of Omeka. Scripto for Omeka Classic creates a single transcription project for the content of your Omeka Classic site. Scripto for Omeka S enables the creation of multiple projects built from shared items in your Omeka S installation.    \n",
       "42  The Virtual Manuscript Room Collaborative Research Environment (VMR CRE) brings community and a toolbox of powerful research components to support all stages of research and production of a digital edition. Beginning with the popular open-source portal, Liferay, the VMR CRE integrates 30 DH components to naturally support: Cataloging witnesses; managing and displaying images; producing well-formed TEI transcriptions using a web-based WYSIWYM editor and storing those transcriptions to a versioned transcription repository; community volunteer task assignment and project management; automatic realtime collation of witnesses; regularization and apparatus editing; online publishing of the final results-- as a traditional apparatus, or with interactive tools which let users choose different ways to visualize the data produced in the edition.    Overview A walk through the workflow at the Institut für neutestamentliche Textforschung (INTF), in their efforts to edit the Editio Critica Maior (ECM), provides opportunity to touch on many components available in the VMR CRE.  Work can be divided into 9 discrete stages, progressively: 1) witness cataloging; 2) witness selection; 3) image management; 4) indexing of folio content; 5) transcribing; 6) collating; 7) regularizing; 8) editing an apparatus; 9) genealogical analysis of the witness corpus.   Metadata and Feature Tagging The VMR CRE stores with each manuscript a very limited set of descriptive data, reserving the primary metadata capture for a dynamic tagging facility called Feature Tagging. A Feature is any defined metadata information which might be captured for a manuscript or manuscript page.  For example, an alternative catalog identifier, an external image repository, the canvas material type, the ink type, the script type; these are all Features which might be tagged on a manuscript; For individual pages: an illumination, a canon table, or even individual sample script characters might be tagged as Features.  These Features must first be defined in the system, and the VMR CRE comes by default with a predefined set of Feature Definitions used at the INTF.  A Feature Definition can specify that zero or more values should be captured with the Feature tag and what those value types and value domains should be.  Once a Feature is defined, it can be used to tag manuscripts or manuscript pages, capturing individual Feature values for each tag, if necessary. Every Feature Definition adds to the number of facets available in the catalog search facility.  For example, one might search for all manuscript folio sides from Egypt which include Illuminations and any part of the Gospel of John.  A Feature tagged to a manuscript page can also include a region box, marking the area on a folio image where the Feature is present.  If a region box is captured, a search query can specify to show the region box clips in the result.  For example, a paleographer might choose to capture a set of representative letters for each manuscript and then perform a search for all double column manuscripts with a height of at least 20cm between the II and V centuries, and to ask the query results to show the representative α (alpha) clips.   Transcription and Reconciliation Transcription work in the VMR CRE is done using a What You See Is What You Mean (WYSIWYM) web-based editor originally developed by the University of Trier in collaboration with the INTF and ITSEE in Birmingham.  This transcription editor has been developed as a plugin for the popular TinyMCE HTML editor component.  The editor includes menus and dialogs to assist the researcher with composing a transcription, without asking the transcriber to learn special markup codes.  The content may then be obtained as EpiDoc influenced TEI. The VMR CRE saves content in a versioned transcription repository backed by Git.  A user may have access to create and edit their own personal transcription, a project-wide transcription, or a site-wide (= published) transcription-- each having version history. The VMR CRE also includes a palaeography tool to assist a transcriber when encountering rare symbols, abbreviations, or ligatures.  If a portion of the unknown text can be identified, the researcher can enter one or more letters and will be presented with images of text instances elsewhere which include these letters, offering possibilities.  As more and more rare text items are tagged, the system grows more helpful. Quality assurance for the ECM requires that a transcription for a manuscript be produced independently by two transcribers.  The products are then compared to each other and differences are reviewed by a manager and reconciled to produce a final transcription.  The VMR CRE provides tools to facilitate this reconciliation work. Collation and Visualization Collation is a key component to find differences in text witnesses when producing a critical edition.  Collation facilities in the VMR CRE are performed by CollateX.  Collation and regularization of uninteresting differences is an iterative cycle in digital editing and the VMR CRE ties these two actions together with an intuitive visual interface.  Visualization of a collation, either during the editing process or for the reader, can be rendered as a variant graph, an alignment table, or as a traditional negative apparatus.    Web Services, Open Programmatic Access The VMR CRE Web Services API layer is primarily useful for exposing the functionality of the VMR CRE to other research projects wishing to access the functionality or contribute to the dataset through their own systems and tools.  The VMR CRE Web Services API generally uses noun/verb nomenclature organized by category.  This means that the last 2 segments of an API URL will consist first of the type of object the call will affect, and second, of the action to be performed on the object.  Any path before the final two segments are merely for organizational purposes.  This is different from a strict REST convention which confines the action to one of 6 HTTP verbs.  The VMR CRE places no semantic meaning on the HTTP verb.  Both GET and POST HTTP verbs are accepted as identical, relegating the verb, or semantic action to the final segment of the URL.  This allows easy testing and examples for every action directly within a web browser.  Parameters to a service request are passed as standard HTTP FORM POST parameters or as query string parameters.     \n",

DM was developed on the Heroku cloud-server platform, where installation and administration is straightforward, after which developing individual projects requires no specific IT expertise.    Features   Highlights Mark up your image and text documents with highlights you can then annotate and link together. Identify discrete moments on images and texts with highlight tools including dots, lines, circles, rectangles, other polygons, text tags, and multiple color options.   Annotations Develop your projects and publications with an unlimited number of annotations on individual highlights and entire images and texts. Highlights and entire documents can host an unlimited number of annotations, and annotations themselves can host additional annotation layers.   Links Once you've marked up your text and image documents with highlights and annotations, you can create links between individual highlights and entire documents, and your links are always bi-directional, so you and other viewers can travel back and forth between highlights.</td>\n",

The digital tool can support users in transcribing texts in various fields. In addition to the actual transcription, the texts can also be annotated and text-genetic facts can be marked up. Transcribo offers the possibility to transcribe texts productively and in a time-saving way, using the same intuitive approach as you are used to from manual transcription. The tool offers all the subtleties needed for a differentiated transcription and supports the working process both efficiently and easily comprehensible.   Transcribe almost like with sheet and pencil Transcribing is done in a graphical editor directly on the facsimile, simulating the procedure of analog transcribing with sheet and pencil. This intuitive approach is an advantage especially when transcribing difficult to decipher manuscripts or heavily revised typescript pages and additionally reduces the learning time for the tool, since no markup language (e.g. TEI/XML) has to be learned. Another advantage of this method is that by working on the facsimile, a positional link between the transcribed text and the image is automatically stored. This positional data can be used in the context of the electronic presentation to visualize the link between text and facsimile for the user in a sustainable way, e.g. in the form of cross-fades or mouse-over effects.   Can be used both locally and with FuD  Transcribo can be used both locally and in conjunction with our FuD system.  In local operation, facsimiles located on the terminal device can be opened and edited. All processed information is stored locally in the form of XML files. When FuD is used in addition, the data is stored in FuD's own relational database, which enables collaborative work. In addition, some functionalities, such as the recording of cross-page phenomena, the correction tool or the storage of text states, are only available in this operating mode. The many years of development work accompanying the project have paid off.  Thus, adaptations and ideas from numerous humanities projects at TCDH have been incorporated into the work and have resulted in a very differentiated and practically tested tool.    Some of the most important features of Transcribo 1.  Fine-grained markup of microgenetic facts  (at document, page, sentence/line, word, and graph levels) 2.  Markup of complex interrelated phenomena/change operations  via relations (page and cross-page) 3.  Correction function  for automated comparison of A and B files from different users to ensure error-free transcription and annotation ('double-blind process') 4.  OCR functionality  for automatic reading of typescripts or prints (Tesseract) 5.  Navigation perspective:  interface to the FuD database (linking facsimiles with metadata recorded in FuD) 6.  Structural perspective:  overview of a text section of any size (synopsis of different graphical representations: Facsimile, transcription, annotations) and possibility of depositing cross-page phenomena. 7.  Module for defining and labeling text states or text layers.    Technical requirements The application was implemented in the Eclipse integrated development environment.

DM was developed on the Heroku cloud-server platform, where installation and administration is straightforward, after which developing individual projects requires no specific IT expertise.    Features   Highlights Mark up your image and text documents with highlights you can then annotate and link together. Identify discrete moments on images and texts with highlight tools including dots, lines, circles, rectangles, other polygons, text tags, and multiple color options.   Annotations Develop your projects and publications with an unlimited number of annotations on individual highlights and entire images and texts. Highlights and entire documents can host an unlimited number of annotations, and annotations themselves can host additional annotation layers.   Links Once you've marked up your text and image documents with highlights and annotations, you can create links between individual highlights and entire documents, and your links are always bi-directional, so you and other viewers can travel back and forth between highlights.    \n",

It is a plugin for Omeka CMS that adds the IIIF specifications in order to serve images like a simple image server, similar to a basic IIP Image, and the UniversalViewer, a unified online player for any file. It can display books, images, maps, audio, movies, pdf, 3D, and anything else as long as the appropriate extension is installed. Rotation, zoom, inside search, etc. may be managed too. Dynamic lists of records may be used, for example for browse pages. The Universal Viewer supports the IXIF media extension too, so manifests can be served for any type of file. For non-images files, it is recommended to use a specific viewer or the Universal Viewer, a widget that can display books, images, maps, audio, movies, pdf, 3D, and anything else as long as the appropriate extension is installed. The Universal Viewer was firstly developed by Digirati for the Wellcome Library of the British Library and the National Library of Wales, then open sourced.   \n",

By and large you can find the charters organized according to archival \"fonds\"; charters that originate from different sources are subsumed under \"Collections\".   General users can:  browse  search  Registered users can:  bookmark documents save and edit documents (description, transcription) with EditMOM3 create indices manipulate images (annotate images, create collections of image fragments, manipulate image fragments) create own charter collections  Special users can:  review user changes (moderators only) manage metadata on archives and collections (metadata manager only) import new data (metadata manager only) translate system messages (translators only) manage users (user manager only) manage static texts (like help, introduction etc., html-authors only)    \n",
       "22  [Transcribo](https://tcdh.uni-trier.de/en/projekt/transcribo) is an editing tool developed by the Trier Center for Digital Humanities as part of the project “Arthur Schnitzler: Digital Historical-Critical Edition”. The digital tool can support users in transcribing texts in various fields. In addition to the actual transcription, the texts can also be annotated and text-genetic facts can be marked up. Transcribo offers the possibility to transcribe texts productively and in a time-saving way, using the same intuitive approach as you are used to from manual transcription. The tool offers all the subtleties needed for a differentiated transcription and supports the working process both efficiently and easily comprehensible.   Transcribe almost like with sheet and pencil Transcribing is done in a graphical editor directly on the facsimile, simulating the procedure of analog transcribing with sheet and pencil. This intuitive approach is an advantage especially when transcribing difficult to decipher manuscripts or heavily revised typescript pages and additionally reduces the learning time for the tool, since no markup language (e.g. TEI/XML) has to be learned. Another advantage of this method is that by working on the facsimile, a positional link between the transcribed text and the image is automatically stored. This positional data can be used in the context of the electronic presentation to visualize the link between text and facsimile for the user in a sustainable way, e.g. in the form of cross-fades or mouse-over effects.   Can be used both locally and with FuD  Transcribo can be used both locally and in conjunction with our FuD system.  In local operation, facsimiles located on the terminal device can be opened and edited. All processed information is stored locally in the form of XML files. When FuD is used in addition, the data is stored in FuD's own relational database, which enables collaborative work. In addition, some functionalities, such as the recording of cross-page phenomena, the correction tool or the storage of text states, are only available in this operating mode. The many years of development work accompanying the project have paid off.  Thus, adaptations and ideas from numerous humanities projects at TCDH have been incorporated into the work and have resulted in a very differentiated and practically tested tool.    Some of the most important features of Transcribo 1.  Fine-grained markup of microgenetic facts  (at document, page, sentence/line, word, and graph levels) 2.  Markup of complex interrelated phenomena/change operations  via relations (page and cross-page) 3.  Correction function  for automated comparison of A and B files from different users to ensure error-free transcription and annotation ('double-blind process') 4.  OCR functionality  for automatic reading of typescripts or prints (Tesseract) 5.  Navigation perspective:  interface to the FuD database (linking facsimiles with metadata recorded in FuD) 6.  Structural perspective:  overview of a text section of any size (synopsis of different graphical representations: Facsimile, transcription, annotations) and possibility of depositing cross-page phenomena. 7.  Module for defining and labeling text states or text layers.    Technical requirements The application was implemented in the Eclipse integrated development environment. It is a rich client application that reuses parts of the development environment and was developed in the Java programming language. We currently provide a version for Windows and macOS operating systems.
